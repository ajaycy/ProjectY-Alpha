# OSINT Challenge: ProjectX-Alpha

A careless developer has accidentally left sensitive information in this repository. 
Your mission is to find:
1. The API key used in this project.
2. The developer's password hidden in older commits.
3. The final flag (a Base64-encoded string).

## Rules
- Do not brute-force anything.
- All information is publicly available.

Good luck!
